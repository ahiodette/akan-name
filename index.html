            <h1>AKAN NAME GENERATOR</h1>
            <p>This system ("<strong>Akan names</strong>") of naming people, came from Ghananian traditional culture
                where the <strong>Akan people of Ghana</strong> frequently name their children after the <em>day of the
                week they were born</em> and the order in which they were born. These <em>day names</em> have further meanings concerning the soul
                and character of the person. Middle names have considerably more variety and can refer to their birth order, twin status, or
                an ancestor's middle name. You, also can check and know which name should be given to you, if you were
                Ghanian from Akan.
            </p>
            <p> This system, that seems to be a game, prompts you to input your <strong><em>date of birth</em></strong> and your 
                <strong><em>gender</em></strong>
                and then get the name accordingly. 
            </p>
